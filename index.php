    <h3>Welcome to howtoscience.net!</h3>
    <p>Let's not beat around the bush: scientific writing is hard. It's a skill, and like all skills worth learning, it takes a lot of time and practice to get it right. However, that doesn't mean there aren't short-cuts you can take on the way.</p>
    <p>I taught science and scientific report writing for years at an Australian university and I found that the major problems most of my students had were that they really weren't sure of exactly what they should be putting (and in many cases, <i>not</i> putting) into their papers.</p>
    <p>Part of the problem is that most students have never even read a scientific paper before. Real papers are very dense, often dry, and always full of jargon that undergraduates dont yet have the knowledge-base to fully understand. This results in a catch-22 situation, where students are being asked to do something that's beyond their grasp because they cannot follow the source material.</p>
    <p>However, there is a way to overcome this; and it's by treating scientific writing much like any other form of story-telling. In this site, I use the example of <i>Star Wars</i> to describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure" target="_blank">three-act narrative structure</a> and how it can be broadly applied to writing scientific papers. At the same time, I provide examples of how to read past the jargon in real reports and understand their underlying structure.</p>
    <p>By using an example with almost universal understanding and appeal, along with real-world examples, I hope to illuminate the process and help you improve your writing skills.</p>
    <p><b>What this site is:</b> a series of pointers aimed at helping you to bypass the jargon and tease out the structure of scientific papers so you can help yourself to improve your writing through understanding.</p>
    <p><b>What this site is not:</b> an encyclopedic, step-by-step "how to" guide covering every aspect of scientific reporting. This is beyond the scope of the site, and there are plenty of other guides, both on-line and in print that do a more comprehensive job.
    <p>I hope that you, dear reader, gain some insight from this aspect of looking at the task of writing reports. I know it certainly improved my abilities in scientific communication.</p>
