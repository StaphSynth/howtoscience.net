# howtoscience.net

[howtoscience.net](http://www.howtoscience.net/) is a free resource for science students looking to improve their skills in scientific communication. It guides the reader through the process of how to approach writing scientific papers using the three-act narrative structure. _Star Wars_ (1977) is used as an example throughout.

## What's here

This is the repository for both the source code and editorial content. It is updated from time to time as I refine and expand it.

Please note that I'm well aware of how bad the PHP is. It will be rectified in due time. For now, it works, so it'll do.
